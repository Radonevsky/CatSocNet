Frontend on react redux

For auth on github pages use:  
login radonevsky@yandex.ru  
pass ReactJS21  
https://radonevsky.github.io/CatSocNet

***Install***  
To install the developer version of the app, you must have installed node.js.  
After cloning the repository, use the npm commands:  
to install all dependencies: ```npm i```,  
to start dev server: ```npm start```

While developing this project, I learned how to solve problems:
1) Creating a business logic layer using the redux library;
2) Drawing business data on the pages using the react library and jsx;
3) Link react and redux to transfer business data to react components using HOC (connect) from the react-redux library;
4) Send requests to the server using promises and the axios library, process responses and errors;
5) Handle asynchronous requests to the server, handle actions with side effects using redux thunks and react hooks;
6) Transfer business data to components using context  and container components;
7) Organizing the lifecycle of class components using lifecycle methods (did mount, did update, will unmount);
8) Organizing the lifecycle of functional components using lifecycle hooks;
9) Processing and submitting data entered by the user (login, info) using the react-final-form, react-hook-form libraries;
10) Avoided repeated complex data processing (sorting, searching) when drawing components using the reselect library;
